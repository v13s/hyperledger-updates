# HYPERLEDGER UPDATES

The tool will assist in getting the PRs curated for the weekly developer
newsletter sent by Hyperledger. The tool will print list of all PRs from
Hyperledger and Hyperledger Labs into a html file that were raised in
last `X` days. The number of days is configurable, current default is set
to be 7. Similarly, it will pull all the releases created in last `X` days.

In addition to the PRs, the tool also polls for the issues with specific
tags and tracks releases on the input organization repositories. It is
customizable to enable any one or all three of these.

Note that the tool expects user to set the GitHub personal access token
with the read access. This is to avoid GitHub from blocking the machine due
to frequent API calls. The tool makes use of
[go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github/) for pulling the data.

## Dependencies

Option GitHub personal access token with read access (this is required
in case of frequent API calls, default rate that GitHub allow is 60).

Set the following environment variable before running the tool

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR LONG PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN HERE>
```

The tool is written in Go version 1.15, you can also use the docker
container runtime engine to package and run it as a container.
Tool also comes with a `docker-compose` file to make it easy to run
the command with default configuration.

Tested `docker` and `docker-compose` versions

- Docker version 19.03.4
- docker-compose version 1.24.1

## Configuration
